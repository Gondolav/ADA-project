# Where to eat safely in Chicago: gaining insight from food establishments inspections

# Abstract
Chicago is home to 16,000 food establishments like restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, wholesalers, lunchrooms, mobile food vendors and more. In this project, we would like to give an overview of the city's food safety over the last decade. To do so, we are using a dataset of all the food inspections performed by the Chicago Department of Public Health's Food Protection Program. The main idea is to identify patterns at the geographical, economical and social levels throughout time. More specifically, we want to study the frequency of the different violations, the way inspections influence food establishments, the relationship between facilities and their location as well as the potential differences between the restaurants' types. With our work, we hope to raise awareness about the Chicago's food safety landscape and instruct people on the quality of the establishments they regularly visit.

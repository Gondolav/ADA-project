# Where to eat safely in Chicago: gaining insight from food establishments inspections

# Abstract
Chicago is home to 16,000 food establishments like restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, wholesalers, lunchrooms, mobile food vendors and more. In this project, we would like to give an overview of the city's food safety over the last decade. To do so, we are using a dataset of all the food inspections performed by the Chicago Department of Public Health's Food Protection Program. The main idea is to identify patterns at the geographical, economical and social levels throughout time. More specifically, we want to study the frequency of the different violations, the way inspections influence food establishments, the relationship between facilities and their location as well as the potential differences between the restaurants' types. With our work, we hope to raise awareness about the Chicago's food safety landscape and instruct people on the quality of the establishments they regularly visit.

# Research questions
## Inspections' effects on establishments
- Does an inspection have a positive effect on the future inspections? i.e. does inspecting increase an establishment’s quality?
- Are inspections requested by the establishments usually favorable?
- Do these establishments still receive regular inspections? i.e. is requesting an inspection advantageous to an establishment to avoid subsequent inspections?
- What is the proportion of successful inspections needed in order to obtain a license? i.e. assess the difficulty to obtain such a license (per facility type).
- What is the evolution of the overall inspection frequency over the last decade?

## Establishments' predispositions to inspection failure
- Which facility type is more likely to fail?
- Is the inspection frequency indeed correlated with the risk category?
- Are restaurants having already failed once more likely to fail again than the others? And are they more likely to close definitively?
- Compare the inspection results of the different food chain restaurant against themselves or other restaurants.
- How are the inspection and establishment types linked with the inspection results?
- Is there a relationship between the type of the restaurant and the quality?

## Violation analysis
- What are the frequencies of each violation?
- Are some violations more frequent than others in an establishment’s failure?
- What are the most frequent violations encountered during complaint-caused inspections?

## Neighborhood and food quality correlation
- Is there a correlation between the violation n°38 (INSECTS, RODENTS, & ANIMALS) and the location?
- How are the inspection results evolving over time and space?
- Is there a relationship between the location of the restaurant and the quality? (economic and social causes)
- What is the most encountered violation category for each neighborhood?

# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.
The [Chicago Department of Public Health's Food Protection Program website](https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-food-inspections#food-inspections.csv) provides us with a well-documented dataset of all the food inspections they have done over the past decade.

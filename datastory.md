# Where to eat safely in Chicago: gaining insight from food establishments inspections

## Introduction (Andrea)
Chicago is home to 16,000 food establishments like restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, wholesalers, lunchrooms, mobile food vendors and more. Through this analysis, we aim to identify patterns at the social and geographical levels throughout time. With our work, we hope to raise awareness about the Chicago's food safety landscape and instruct people on the quality of the establishments they regularly visit.

## Facility type analysis and their predisposition to failure (5.3) (Ludo)
- draw attention on facility types where special care should be taken when choosing the one to go to (where to buy its liquor, where to go take a drink, to which wholesale distributors you should go to provision...)
- pb: we have a few insights but not a nice plot

## Compare famous fast-food restaurant chains between them (5.3) (Ludo)
- this is the kind of restaurant that everyone knows and uses, so it is interesting which ones are the most (least) safe, at least in the scope of Chicago
- we choose to focus on 15 chains with at least (around) twenty establishments in Chicago (stacked bar plot)
- beware of scale difference (20 vs 300)
- conclude on which brand or which kind of fast food (burgers, pizza, tacos, chicken, sandwich) are more safely
- shall we compare these chains to the other restaurants? (no time...)

## Violation Analysis (5.5) (Hugo)
- we can start by mentioning the most frequent violations, the ones leading to failure, the ones due to complaints
- basically write the insights we wrote on the notebook and draw plots:
  - one with the frequency of each violation: bars or scatter
  - 2 bar plots with the evolution when considering failure/complaints
- also talk about violation per neighbourhood -> transition to next part

## Evolution of the food quality per Community Area over time (5.4) (Thomas)
- Say why it is interesting to study the food quality by CA (data on CA population available, people can know specifically about their place, the city can identify the neighbourhoods where they should focus their work of improving the (food) safety)
- 2 ways of proceeding (MAPS):
  - by risk
  - by fail rate
- make use of the statistics we gathered (is there a way to plot them ?) and draw conclusions

## Inspection effects on establishments (5.2) (Hugo)
- Does an inspection have a positive effect ?
- Are inspections requested by the establishments usually favorable ?
- Evolution of the frequency

## Conclusion (Andrea)
- Main idea: inequalities seem to be linked not only to facility type or geographical location but also to people's wealth, ethnicity and education. City should try to reduce those differences by investing
